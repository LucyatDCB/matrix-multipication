# matrix-multipication
For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. The product of matrices A and B is denoted as AB.

In this repository there are two pyhton code.....
#first code
In this code the matrix is already pre-inputed, you cant change the matrix.

#second code
In this code , the matrix is determined by the user...
    first it will ask dimension of the matrix(no of row and column)
     then it willask for the numbers of each row written a space between then

try out the codes
